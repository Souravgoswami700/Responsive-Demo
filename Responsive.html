        <h3>Importance of Nature</h3>
        <p>
            Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the
            greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to 
            recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets,
            writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation 
            inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. 
            They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. 
            Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink,
            the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, 
            the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and 
            consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the
            modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and 
            start valuing nature before it gets too late.

        <h3>Impact of Pollution</h3>
        <p>
            Pollution is the process by which harmful substances (called pollutants) are 
            released into the natural environment. The list of pollutants includes volcanic 
            ash, trash, chemicals released by industries, smoke, plastics, etc. With the
            advancement of technology and with new inventions, the lives of people have been
            made easier, but the irony is that these eventually end up polluting the atmosphere,
            thereby becoming a major threat to all living things which are a part of planet Earth.
            The major types of pollution include air pollution, water pollution and land pollution. 
            Air pollution is the contamination of the atmosphere mainly due to smoke from vehicles, 
            factories and forest fires. Water gets polluted when toxic substances like chemicals and
            plastic waste are discharged into the water bodies, and the process by which accumulated 
            solid and liquid waste contaminate the soil and groundwater are referred to as land pollution.
